# sugercane production analysis
This project focuses on exploring, cleaning, preprocessing and analyzing Sugarcane Production dataset to understand agricultural production patterns, yield behavior, land usage and per-person production distribution.

This is the initial stage towards my Data Analytics journey, where I practice real-world exploratory data analysis (EDA) and convert raw data into insights.
